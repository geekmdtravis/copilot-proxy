# Spec Implementation Plan

## Project Environment Setup
- [x] Initialize the project with a TypeScript setup (package.json, tsconfig.json, etc.).
- [x] Install dependencies: express, dotenv, morgan, typescript, ts-node, @types/node, @types/express, and @types/morgan.

## REST API Server Implementation (src/server.ts)
- [x] Create an asynchronous REST API with Express.
- [x] Create a POST endpoint at /v1/chat/completions that:
  - Parses a JSON payload.
  - Checks for a boolean parameter `stream`.
  - If `stream` is false or not provided, returns a JSON response with the following mock data:
    ```json
    {
      "id": "chatcmpl-mock",
      "object": "chat.completion",
      "created": 1234567890,
      "choices": [
        {
          "index": 0,
          "message": { "role": "assistant", "content": "This is a mock response." },
          "finish_reason": "stop"
        }
      ],
      "usage": { "prompt_tokens": 5, "completion_tokens": 7, "total_tokens": 12 }
    }
    ```
  - If `stream` is true, initiates streaming:
    - Sets the header `Content-Type: text/event-stream`.
    - Uses asynchronous delays (e.g., `setTimeout`) and `res.write` to simulate the streaming response.
    - Logs the progress of each data chunk sent.

## LiteLLM Client Implementation (src/client.ts)
- [ ] Develop a client based on LiteLLM that:
  - Sends requests to the API for both streaming and non-streaming modes.
  - Processes the responses, including aggregating streamed data if applicable.

## Unit & Integration Tests
- [ ] Unit Tests:
  - Test that the non-streaming endpoint returns the expected JSON structure and data.
  - Test that the streaming response is properly set up (headers, chunks).
- [ ] Integration Test:
  - Use the LiteLLM client to send requests to the REST API.
  - Verify the complete end-to-end process and validate the response against the expected mock data.

## Configuration Management and Logging
- [ ] Create a configuration module (e.g., src/config.ts) to load server configurations (port, log levels, etc.) from environment variables with default values.
- [x] Integrate logging (e.g., using morgan) to log incoming requests and streaming events.

## Documentation
- [ ] Update the readme.md file with:
  - Installation and configuration instructions.
  - Build and run instructions for the API server.
  - How to use the LiteLLM client.
  - Testing instructions (unit and integration tests).
